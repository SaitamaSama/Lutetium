    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Why is traveling important?</h2>
    <section class="imaged-paragraph">
        <p>
            Travel has been linked to a lower risk of heart disease. A nine-year study of 12,000 men found that those who
            took at least one vacation per year were 30% less likely to die from heart disease. Another study showed
            individuals who didn't take a vacation were twice as likely to have a heart attack.
            <br>
            <br>
            Vacation and relaxation go hand-in-hand. Everyone needs time away from the office to rejuvenate. Studies
            show travel does reduce stress. It also improves our ability to handle stress long after we return home.
            Studies also show decreased stress in travelers had lower levels of stress hormones.
            <br>
            <br>
            The benefits of travel and the resulting traveler’s high extend into the workplace as well. Employees
            who travel have lower rates of absenteeism, higher productivity levels, and generally report feeling less
            burnt out.

    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Top tourist destinations: New York</h2>
    <section class="imaged-paragraph">
        <div class="img" style="background-image: url(Images/freedom-tower.jpg);"></div>
        <p>
            The first time you go to New York, go ahead and be a sight-seer—everyone should visit the Statue of Liberty,
            the Met, Times Square, etc. But on a return trip, pick a neighbourhood and go deep. You’ll
            find hole-in-the-wall bars, great delis, quirky shops… exploring the non-touristy side of New York is an
            incredibly rewarding experience for a traveller.

    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Top tourist destinations: Barcelona</h2>
    <section class="imaged-paragraph">
        <p>
            Stroll Las Ramblas and enjoy Barcelona's unique blend of Catalan culture, distinctive architecture, lively
            nightlife and trendy, stylish hotels. You'll find Europe's best-preserved Gothic Quarter here, as well as
            amazing architectural works by Gaudi. La Sagrada Familia, considered Gaudi's masterpiece, is still under
            construction (your entrance fee helps to fund the project). Feel like a picnic? Look no further than the
            rambunctious La Boqueria market, where you can stock up on local delicacies.

    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Top tourist destinations: Prague</h2>
    <section class="imaged-paragraph">
        <div class="img" style="background-image: url(Images/prague.jpg);"></div>
        <p>
            We hear the question, "What’s the next Prague?" a lot. But while we’re all for discovering great new
            destinations, we hardly think Prague is over. Sure, everyone’s heard of it, but it’s still a grand city
            with extraordinary historic and cultural sights, and it’s definitely worth a visit. The often-rebuilt Prague
            Castle has overlooked the city since the 9th century, and the synagogues and cemetery of the Jewish Quarter
            are must-sees. Nightlife here is diverse and plentiful, from trendy clubs to sophisticated wine bars to
            late-night cellar bars.

    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Top tourist destinations: Bora Bora</h2>
    <section class="imaged-paragraph">
        <p>
            The relatively small island of Bora Bora is an activity giant, offering visitors the chance to experience
            a 4x4 safari, sunbathe and swim at white sandy beaches, dive in a natural underwater park among fish and
            corals, experience thrilling shark feedings, or circle the turquoise lagoon by boat. And Bora Bora is a
            superlative romantic spot. Fall captive to this lush gem of a Polynesian island by sharing an intimate
            midnight dinner on the beach; visiting the Lagoonarium, the Diving Centre, the Coral Gardens or the Leopard
            Rays Trench; or taking it all in from the lofty heights of 2,300-foot Mount Otemanu.
